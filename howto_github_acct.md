# How to Create a GitHub Account

---

To share your data, and track your analysis, we are going to utilize github. Please send me your github user id ASAP. If you donâ€™t have a github account, please create one (mentors too). Git is a version control software and github is a cloudstorage server that serves as the hub of collaborative projects like yours and it is where the master copy of your data and data analysis scripts lie.
