# 🚀 Getting Started with GitHub Codespaces & the GitHub Student Developer Pack

This guide will help you set up **GitHub Codespaces** for your projects and apply for the **GitHub Student Developer Pack**. You should already have a GitHub account before starting.

:bangbang: Please send me your github user id ASAP if you have not already given it to me, e.g. in the quiz.

## ❓ What is GitHub Codespaces?  

GitHub Codespaces is a **cloud-based development environment**.  
It gives you a full Visual Studio Code editor running in the browser, connected directly to your GitHub repositories.  

- No need to install anything on your computer.  
- Preconfigured with common programming tools.  
- Runs in the cloud, so you can code from any device with internet access.  
- Saves your changes back to GitHub just like working locally.

## ☑️ Step 0: Create a GitHub Account 
- [Instructions](howto_github_acct.md)

## :weight_lifting_woman: 1. Enable GitHub Codespaces

1. Go to [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).
2. Click **Get Started**.
3. If prompted, sign in with your GitHub account.
4. You’ll be directed to your [Codespaces dashboard](https://github.com/codespaces).  
   Here you can create and manage codespaces linked to your repositories.

## :magic_wand: 2. Create Your First Codespace  	

1. [Initialize your Personal "Intro to CLI" Assignment Repo](https://classroom.github.com/a/EWxbhNfJ)  (right click and open in new window)
2. Click the green **Code** button (top right).
3. Select the **Codespaces** tab.
4. Click **Create codespace on main**.  
   > This will launch a cloud-based VS Code environment linked to your repo.

5. Wait for it to build (first time may take a few minutes).
6. Once it’s ready, you can start coding directly in your browser or connect with your local VS Code.

✅ Congratulations — you now have a full dev environment in the cloud!

## 🛑 3. Stopping Your Codespace

Codespaces run on cloud resources and use up your free hours. To save hours, always stop your Codespace when you’re not working.  

1. In GitHub, go to the **Codespaces** tab of your repository or your [Codespaces dashboard](https://github.com/codespaces). (right click and open in new tab)
2. Find the Codespace you want to stop.
3. Click the **… (three dots)** menu.
4. Select **Stop codespace**.  

💡TIP: Stopping is like closing your laptop — your files and environment are saved, but resources stop running.

---

## ⏳ 4. Usage Limits

- **Free Accounts:** 120 hours of Codespaces per month on a basic machine type.  
- **Student Developer Pack:** Increases your free hours and includes larger machine options.  
- **Billing:** If you go over the free hours, Codespaces will not start unless you add a payment method.  (Don't pay!)

🔎 You can track your usage on your [Billing & Plans page](https://github.com/settings/billing/summary).
