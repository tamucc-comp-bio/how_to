# How to Set Up Your Computer for Computational Biology

Identify the operating system (OS) of your computer: Windows, Mac, or Linux. Then, follow each of the tasks below for your OS.  

_Neither ChromeOS, iOS, nor Android are  supported by [R Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RStudio), therefore it is going to be best for you to use a remote server like the TAMU Launch HPC which allows you to run RStudio in a webpage._

## Windows Only

For those with Windows OS, install a [linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) "virtual machine" ([Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/desktop/wsl)) using [Windows Subsystem Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux).  This allows you run a Linux environment within Windows, just like it was an app.
