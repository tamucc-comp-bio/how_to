### [`data/`](data/)
- **Purpose**: This directory contains both raw and processed data files. Raw data files represent unaltered data as collected, while processed files are in tidy format, ready for analysis.
- **Key Files**:
  - `growth_measurements.csv`: Raw measurements of plant growth recorded in the field.
  - `soil_samples.csv`: Raw soil composition data collected from different plots.
  - `growth_measurements_cleaned.csv`: Plant growth data after processing (outliers removed, normalization applied).
- **Data Processing**: Includes steps such as outlier removal, normalization, and any transformations needed for analysis.

---

### [`documentation/`](documentation/)
- **Purpose**: This directory holds all project documentation, including manuals, protocols, and supporting documents.
- **Contents**:
  - Project protocols
  - Data collection methods
  - Analysis guidelines

### [`scripts/`](scripts/)
- **Purpose**: Contains all scripts used to process, clean, and analyze the data. 
- **Key Scripts**:
  - `data_cleaning.R`: Cleans raw data from `../data/growth_measurements.csv` and saves the cleaned version.
  - `regression_analysis_script.R`: Performs regression analysis on cleaned data and generates outputs in `../results/`.
- **How to Run**:
  - Ensure R is installed and required packages are available.
  - Run the scripts from the command line or R environment as:

### [`results/`](results/)
- **Purpose**: This directory stores the results from data analysis, including figures, summary tables, and reports.
- **Key Files**:
  - `growth_analysis_output.csv`: Regression analysis output on plant growth data.
  - `summary_plots.pdf`: Plots summarizing key results of the analysis.

---

### [`references/`](references/)
- **Purpose**: Stores reference materials such as literature, articles, and other sources used in the project.
